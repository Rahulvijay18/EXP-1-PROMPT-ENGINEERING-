## Theory
1. Foundational Concepts of Generative AI

Generative AI creates new outputs (text, images, music, etc.) by learning data distributions.

Works on probability and representation learning.

Goal: Generate human-like creative and coherent content.

2. Generative AI Architectures

Autoencoders (AE): Encode & decode data for compression.

GANs: Generator vs. Discriminator model for realistic images/videos.

VAEs: Latent variable models for generating data variations.

Transformers: Use self-attention, backbone of modern LLMs (GPT, BERT).

3. Applications of Generative AI

Text assistants (ChatGPT), code generation, translation.

Image/video generation (DALL·E, MidJourney).

Healthcare: Drug design, protein folding.

Education: Automated tutoring, summarization.

Business: Report automation, synthetic data.

4. Impact of Scaling in LLMs

Larger models = better accuracy, reasoning, fluency.

Emergent abilities appear at scale.

Challenges: High computational cost, energy use, bias in data.

## Output

A structured comprehensive report covering:

Fundamentals of Generative AI.

Architectures (GANs, VAEs, Transformers).

Applications across multiple domains.

Scaling effects in LLMs.

This output gives a clear understanding of how Generative AI works, where it is applied, and the implications of scaling.

## Result

Thus, the experiment result proves that scaling combined with transformer-based architectures is the driving force behind modern LLMs and their applications.
